## About

http://Slowordown.com is a project I worked on in summer of 2013 to learn Ruby on Rails.

The basic idea is to track the load time of the top X domains on the internet, and to tweet if they are down.

## Status

After I joined Simple Energy, I abandoned the project.  The audience has continued to grow since then.
